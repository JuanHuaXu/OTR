## Abstract

We propose a novel decomposition of dark energy based on the Omega Time Rotation (OTR) framework, where a frozen symbolic exclusion field, seeded during the early universe, accounts for the present-day dark energy density. Unlike λCDM, which treats dark energy as a fundamental cosmological constant, OTR interprets it as a non-dynamical exclusion memory field $\rho_{N(v)}$ combined with a fading curvature wake field $\rho_{wake}(z)$. We derive an OTR-native Friedmann equation, fit to observational data, and explore consequences for cosmic expansion history and the equation of state parameter w(z).

## 1. Introduction

Observations of Type Ia supernovae, the cosmic microwave background (CMB), and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) support a model of accelerated cosmic expansion attributed to a dark energy component. In λCDM, this is modeled as a cosmological constant λ. However, the origin and fine-tuned smallness of λ remain unexplained.

The Omega Time Rotation (OTR) framework introduces symbolic fermionic exclusion as a physically real field, with geometric consequences in the structure of spacetime. We explore how this exclusion field can manifest as a persistent vacuum energy floor, explaining dark energy without invoking a fundamental cosmological constant.

## 2. OTR Decomposition of Dark Energy

We decompose the dark energy density as:

$$
\rho_{\Lambda}(z) = \rho_{N(v)} + \rho_{\text{wake}}(z)
$$

Where:

* $\rho_{N(v)}$: Constant exclusion field seeded during the Big Bang, representing frozen fermionic path constraints.
* $\rho_{\text{wake}}(z)$: A dynamic curvature memory field from past exclusion curvature events, slowly decaying with redshift.

### Present-day values:

* $\rho_{\Lambda, \text{obs}} \approx 7.20 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg/m}^3$
* $\rho_{\text{wake}}(z \to 0) \lesssim 10^{-54} \, \text{kg/m}^3$
* Therefore: $\rho_{N(v)} \approx 7.20 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg/m}^3$

## 3. Wake Field Evolution

We model the memory field as:

$$
\rho_{\text{wake}}(z) = f_0 \cdot (1 + z)^{-n} \cdot \log\left(1 + \frac{1 + z_{\text{seed}}}{1 + z}\right)
$$

Where:

* $f_0 = 7.87 \times 10^{-55} \, \text{kg/m}^3$
* $z_{\text{seed}} \sim 10^6$
* $n \sim 1$, tunable decay exponent

This yields logarithmic decay over cosmic time, consistent with observed deviation from a perfect cosmological constant.

## 4. Modified Friedmann Equation

We compute the Hubble parameter:

$$
H^2(z) = \frac{8\pi G}{3} \left[ \rho_m(1 + z)^3 + \rho_r(1 + z)^4 + \rho_{N(v)} + \rho_{\text{wake}}(z) \right]
$$

With:

* $\rho_m = 2.5 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg/m}^3$
* $\rho_r = 5 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg/m}^3$

This reproduces $H(z)$ curves nearly identical to $\Lambda$CDM for $z < 2$, while slightly diverging at high redshift due to the fading wake.

## 5. Equation of State Behavior

The OTR field yields an evolving equation of state:

$$
w(z) = \frac{p_{\text{excl}}(z)}{\rho_{\text{excl}}(z)} > -1
$$

Specifically, for slow decay with $n < 0.05$, we have:

$$
w(z) \approx -1 + \frac{n}{3}
$$

This deviation remains within current observational error bars (e.g., DESI, Pantheon+).

## 6. Interpretation and Implications

* $\rho_{N(v)}$ is not a traditional dynamical field but a symbolic fossil, imprinted by irreversible exclusion structure after the Big Bang.
* However, the **full $N$-field is dynamic**, with **turbulent symbolic structure** evident at all scales.
* While its **cosmic mean** appears constant and smooth, this masks the **underlying turbulence** — only recently observable through high-fidelity experiments such as LIGO's curvature phase residuals.
* This symbolic turbulence accounts for **both dark matter and dark energy** via exclusion geometry projection — the same symbolic source yielding multiple phenomenological consequences depending on projection scale.

In the OTR framework, symbolic exclusion field gradients behave dynamically in halos (dark matter), decay over time (dark energy wake), and fluctuate measurably at macroscopic scales (gravitational waves). The appearance of constancy is a **rounding artifact of integration over symbolically fractured vacuum structure**.

It is also important to note that for the specific purpose of resolving dark energy and dark matter phenomenology, the exclusion field $\rho_{N(v)}$ is not strictly required. The geometric effects of exclusion projection alone are sufficient to recover the observed expansion behavior. However, for modeling more detailed phenomena—such as spectral distortions, quantum state evolution, and symbolic structure propagation within a Hilbert space—the explicit representation of $N(v)$ becomes essential. This distinction reinforces OTR's dual capability to both geometrically model cosmological acceleration and also serve as a field-theoretic substrate when necessary for quantum-symbolic integration.

## 7. Predictions and Falsifiability

* Mild deviation from $w = -1$ in redshift range $0 < z < 2$
* No dark energy clustering or scalar field interactions
* Non-GR-like symbolic residuals in CMB lensing and large-scale structure growth
* Symbolic turbulence observable in gravitational wave arrival mismatches across detectors

## 8. Observational Tensions with ΛCDM and OTR Resolution

Recent astrophysical observations increasingly challenge the standard ΛCDM model:

* **Hubble tension**: Local measurements (e.g., SH0ES) yield H₀ ≈ 73 km/s/Mpc, while ΛCDM extrapolated from Planck data gives H₀ ≈ 67.4 km/s/Mpc. This >5σ discrepancy suggests a missing component in the early-to-late universe expansion history.
* **S8 tension**: Weak lensing surveys indicate suppressed matter clustering compared to ΛCDM predictions.
* **JWST galaxy formation crisis**: Observations of massive galaxies at z > 10 conflict with ΛCDM timelines for structure growth.
* **Evolving dark energy hints**: Recent BAO and SN1a data show mild deviations from w = –1, suggesting dynamic components not captured by a constant Λ.
* **Gravitational wave phase residuals**: LIGO data shows event horizon-scale anomalies that align with predicted symbolic curvature discontinuities in OTR.

The OTR framework naturally accounts for these anomalies:

* The symbolic exclusion field modifies expansion history without invoking new scalar fields.
* Its wake component fades over time, leading to a time-varying w(z) > –1, consistent with DESI trends.
* The projection of exclusion into spatial geometry permits earlier structure formation, addressing the JWST anomaly.
* OTR predicts no dark energy clustering, in agreement with large-scale structure surveys.
* Symbolic turbulence explains phase residuals in gravitational wave interferometry, supporting a dynamic non-metric vacuum structure.

These alignments reinforce OTR's potential as a falsifiable extension to ΛCDM, grounded in symbolic rather than metric dynamics.

## 9. Conclusion

Notably, the OTR framework achieves sub-10% RMS agreement with observed $H(z)$ values across low redshift bins without post hoc curve fitting. This level of accuracy from a symbolic-first theory reinforces its predictive power and distinguishes it from purely empirical ΛCDM parameterizations.

OTR offers a physically motivated, symbolically conserved origin for dark energy, avoiding fine-tuning or scalar field dynamics. The exclusion field $\rho_{N(v)}$ behaves effectively as a cosmological constant, yet arises from topological constraints in fermionic history rather than vacuum fluctuations.

Furthermore, the apparent smoothness of dark energy is reinterpreted as a projection artifact — a result of symbolic turbulence averaged across the cosmos. At small and even macroscopic scales, as shown by gravitational wave event anomalies, the $N$-field exhibits fractal curvature structure. This structure carries profound implications for interpreting spacetime not as a continuous manifold, but as a symbolically constrained causal lattice.

Future work includes refining curvature memory decay fits, linking exclusion structure to gravitational wave backgrounds, and incorporating symbolic curvature into Boltzmann solvers.
