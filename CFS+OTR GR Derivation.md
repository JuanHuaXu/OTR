## Abstract

We present a step-by-step derivation bridging the Causal Fermion Systems (CFS) formalism and General Relativity (GR), using the symbolic framework of Omega Time Rotation (OTR) as a translation layer. By promoting the symbolic exclusion field to an operator-theoretic measure, and mapping symbolic curvature gradients into operator spectra, we derive an effective Einstein field equation from first principles in CFS. This work demonstrates how OTR curvature and exclusion structures provide a geometric interpretation of the CFS action, thereby realizing a full unification pathway from operator dynamics to classical gravity.

## 1. CFS Action Principle

Let $\mathcal{H}$ be a separable Hilbert space, and let $F(x) \in \mathcal{F} \subset \, \text{L}(\mathcal{H})$ be a self-adjoint operator with finite rank and trace. Define a universal measure $\rho$ on $\mathcal{F}$. The CFS action is:

$$\mathcal{S}[\rho] = \iint_{\mathcal{F} \times \mathcal{F}} \mathcal{L}(x, y) \, d\rho(x) \, d\rho(y)$$

The Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}(x,y)$ is typically defined by operator spectral overlap:

$$\mathcal{L}(x, y) = \| F(x)F(y) \|^2 - \lambda \, \| F(x) \|^2 \| F(y) \|^2$$

## 2. Introducing Symbolic Exclusion via OTR

In OTR, the exclusion field $N(x)$ represents frozen fermionic constraints from early-universe symbolic topology. We promote $N(x)$ to an operator trace:

$$N(x) \leftrightarrow \text{Tr}[F(x)]$$

Symbolic curvature tensors are:

$$\mathcal{R}\_{\mu\nu} \sim \nabla_\mu \nabla_\nu N(x) - g_{\mu\nu} \Box N(x)$$

Thus, the symbolic curvature gradient emerges as a functional of variations in operator spectra across $\rho$.

## 3. Stress-Energy Tensor in CFS with OTR Structure

Using the variation of correlation operators $F(x)$, we define an effective stress-energy tensor:

$$T_{\mu\nu}^{\text{eff}} = T_{\mu\nu}^{\text{matter}} + T_{\mu\nu}^{N(v)} + T_{\mu\nu}^{\text{wake}}(z)$$

Where:

* $T_{\mu\nu}^{N(v)}$ is the frozen exclusion background, seeded by early-universe neutrino exclusion pressure (fermionic trace invariant)
* $T_{\mu\nu}^{\text{wake}}(z) \sim \delta \text{Tr}[F(x)] \cdot \log(1 + z\)$

---

## 4. Variation of the Action and Projection to Spacetime

Varying $\mathcal{S}[\rho]$ under perturbations $\delta\rho$:

$\delta \mathcal{S}[\rho] = 0 \Rightarrow \text{Euler-Lagrange operator equations}$

We project this operator structure into spacetime using the OTR geometric prescription:

$$\mathcal{G}\_{\mu\nu} = 8\pi G \left( T_{\mu\nu}^{\text{matter}} + \rho_{N(v)} g_{\mu\nu} + f(z) g_{\mu\nu} \right)$$

---

## 5. Recovering Einstein’s Field Equations

Thus, Einstein’s field equations emerge as:

$$
\mathcal{G}\_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = 8\pi G T_{\mu\nu}^{\mathrm{eff}}
$$

with:

* $\Lambda = \rho_{N(v)} + f(z)$
* $f(z) = f_0 (1 + z)^{-n} \log(1 + z_{\text{seed}} / (1 + z))$

This encapsulates dynamic symbolic wake decay and frozen exclusion memory, yielding a dark energy decomposition derived from first principles.

## 6. Conclusion

By translating symbolic exclusion structure from OTR into CFS operator formalism, and performing variational analysis on the CFS action, we recover Einstein's field equations with OTR-native dark energy terms. This bridges operator-level quantum causal structure with macroscopic geometry, enabling a rigorous unification pathway from symbolic physics to general relativity.

Future work will extend this mapping to include symbolic curvature tensors for matter fields, and full Boltzmann equation reinterpretations under operator-based exclusion dynamics.
