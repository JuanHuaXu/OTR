## Abstract

This paper presents the chronological reasoning, theoretical motivation, and mathematical derivation of Omega Time Rotation (OTR), a framework proposing that spacetime curvature and gravity arise from fermionic exclusion-induced temporal gradients. By extending symbolic reasoning into physical geometry, we demonstrate how exclusion structures induce anisotropic time slicing, generating curvature consistent with general relativity. This manuscript formalizes the evolution of OTR from conceptual insight to mathematical formulation and establishes the groundwork for its integration into broader quantum geometric frameworks.

## 1. Motivation and Initial Observations

The core motivation of OTR arose from the mismatch between quantum field theory and general relativity in describing the origin of curvature and the passage of time. Traditional GR treats time as an input, while quantum systems define time relationally. The paradox deepens around black holes, where time becomes spacelike, and within fermionic systems, where the Pauli exclusion principle introduces persistent structure.

Initial insight (March 2025): **Time may be emergent from fermionic exclusion.**

Observational support:

* Strong gravitational effects localize around high fermion density.
* Temporal dilation is observable in exclusion-dense environments (e.g., neutron stars).
* Anisotropies in time alignment (symbolic curvature gradients) appear to be linked with gravitational structure.

## 2. Symbolic Exclusion as the Root of Curvature

We posit a symbolic exclusion field, $N(x)$, representing the density of frozen fermionic states at location $x$. This exclusion field is not energetic but symbolic: a record of forbidden states that geometrically induces anisotropy in time slicing.

**Postulate:**

> The exclusion field $N(x)$ modulates the local rate of proper time.

This leads to the **omega rotation hypothesis**:

* As $N(x)$ increases, the local time axis rotates away from the global frame, creating effective curvature.
* The divergence in proper time between observers is a geometric manifestation of exclusion pressure.

## 3. Mathematical Framework: Omega Time Rotation

**Symbolic exclusion field definition:**
$N(x) \in \mathbb{R}^+ \quad \text{with} \quad \partial_t N(x) = 0 \quad \text{(frozen field)}$

**Proper time distortion from omega rotation:**
$\Delta \tau(x) = \Delta t \cdot \sqrt{1 - \Omega^2(x)}$
Where:

* $\Omega(x) = f(N(x))$ is the local angular deviation of the time vector from global temporal alignment.
* $f(N)$ is a monotonic increasing function derived from symbolic geometry.

**Symbolic curvature tensor:**
$\mathcal{R}_{\mu\nu} = \nabla_\mu \nabla_\nu N(x) - g_{\mu\nu} \Box N(x)$

**Dark energy decomposition:**
$\rho_{\Lambda}(z) = \rho_{N(v)} + \rho_{\text{wake}}(z)$

**Wake decay model:**
$\rho_{\text{wake}}(z) = \rho_{\text{wake},0} (1 + z)^{-\gamma}$
Where $\gamma$ is derived from observed gravitational memory decay.

**Dark matter potential from exclusion field:**
$\Phi_{\text{excl}} = \int_{V} \frac{G \cdot N(x')}{|x - x'|^2} \, dV'$
Symbolic exclusion potential from surrounding structure.

**OTR Hubble parameter reconstruction:**
$H^2(z) = \frac{8\pi G}{3} [\rho_m(z) + \rho_r(z) + \rho_{N(v)} + \rho_{\text{wake}}(z)]$
Where:

* $\rho_{N(v)}$: seeded by neutrino exclusion
* $\rho_{\text{wake}}(z)$: decaying curvature memory

**Symbolic curvature Lagrangian:**
$\mathcal{L}_N = -\frac{1}{2} (\partial_\mu N)(\partial^\mu N) - V(N)$

**Exclusion potential form (example):**
$V(N) = \lambda N^4$
Or other symmetry-preserving forms.

**Unified Lagrangian (Work to be Done):**
We tentatively propose the following symbolic structure as a potential point of contact with causal operator formalisms:
$\mathcal{L}_{\text{OTR-total}} = \mathcal{L}_N + \mathcal{L}_{\text{matter}} + \mathcal{L}_{\text{interaction}} + \mathcal{L}_{\text{background}}$
Where each term is intended to map to physical, symbolic, or spectral domains consistent with CFS. This symbolic unification remains under active development and is intended to serve as a conceptual bridge toward full Hilbert-space embedding.

## 4. Empirical Predictions and Tests

OTR naturally predicts:

* Time dilation around dense fermion fields (matches GR but from exclusion root)
* Symbolic wake structures from moving fermionic bodies
* Residual gravitational effects in low-matter regions due to frozen exclusion background
* Dark energy as a decaying symbolic wake field from the Big Bang

We define:
$\rho_{\Lambda}(z) = \rho_{N(v)} + \rho_{\text{wake}}(z)$
Where:

* $\rho_{N(v)}$: Cosmic background exclusion field, seeded by neutrinos
* $\rho_{\text{wake}}(z)$: Redshift-dependent curvature memory from structure formation

**Experimental efforts and observations:**

* **April 2025:** Global atomic clock data (NIST/PTB/SYRTE) correlated with gravitational wave events suggest residual time anisotropies consistent with OTR ([Delva et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.221102)).
* **May 2025:** LIGO/VIRGO discrepancy in GW170817 detection triangulation offers a falsifiable test bed for OTR curvature tensor predictions ([Abbott et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.161101)).
* **May 2025:** Neutrino exclusion as a seeding mechanism for $\rho_{N(v)}$ resolves sub-10% discrepancies in H(z) across redshift buckets ([Planck 2018 Results](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.06209); [Scolnic et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/aab9bb)).
* **May 2025:** Omega rotation offers a natural mechanism for gravitational redshift in terms of time-space conversion in high-curvature events ([Misner, Thorne, Wheeler, 1973](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691177793/gravitation)).
* **May 2025:** The 2.1 solar mass black hole formation limit observed in LIGO data is consistent with OTR exclusion thresholds ([Margalit & Metzger, 2017](https://doi.org/10.3847/2041-8213/aa991c)).
* **June 2025:** OTR explains the absence of photon stars via exclusion asymmetry and the lack of symbolic wake generation by bosons.

## 5. Integration with Quantum Frameworks

OTR connects naturally to Causal Fermion Systems (CFS) via the identification:
$N(x) \leftrightarrow \text{Tr}[F(x)] \quad \text{in CFS operator algebra}$

This allows symbolic curvature tensors to be expressed as variations in operator spectra, and geometric dynamics to emerge from spectral differences.

## 6. Conclusion and Future Directions

OTR provides a consistent symbolic-to-physical translation from exclusion-based causality to curvature. Its predictions align with observed gravitational phenomena and offer alternative interpretations of dark energy, black hole structure, and cosmological time asymmetry.

Next steps include:

* Finalizing a CFS-integrated Lagrangian
* High-redshift validation of OTR Hubble predictions
* Testing gravitational phase rotation effects across time-separated detectors
* Expanding into quantum chromodynamic regimes where exclusion overlap is maximal
* Formalizing photon confinement limits and wake conditions
* Cross-validating neutrino seeding of the exclusion background with CMB anisotropies
* Completing the symbolic Lagrangian unification proposal outlined in Section 3 for potential merger with CFS formalism
